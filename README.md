# Binary-Classification

This repository contains Python code for a machine learning project that evaluates the performance of different classification algorithms on a binary classification dataset. The project includes data visualisation, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

# Introduction

This project demonstrates how to:
- Load and explore a binary classification dataset.
- Visualise data through histograms, heatmaps, and box plots.
- Train and evaluate multiple classification algorithms, including:
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Compare model performances using various metrics.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains 700 rows and 10 columns, including 9 features and 1 target class.

# Visualisations
Visualisations
- **Histograms**: Histograms display the distribution of individual features.
- **Heatmap**: A heatmap of feature correlations shows relationships between variables.
- **Box Plots**: Box plots compare feature distributions across the two target classes.
- **Confusion Matrices**:Confusion matrices for each algorithm visualise true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
